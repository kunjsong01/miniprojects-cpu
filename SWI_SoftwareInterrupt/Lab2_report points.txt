Lab2_report points:

- Bug: In text_out.s, remove "ENTRY", otherwise multiple ENTRY lines confuse the compiler
- Copy TextOut subroutine to swi.s, change to MOVS
- In vectors.s, change SWI_Addr to My_SWI_Handler
(Now the program should print everything when running)

- Click on swi_test.s to see the diassembly code (to show the memory address!)
- Set breakpoint in the first line of My_SWI_Handler, to be able to pause and see the value in memory
	* click on Processor Views -> Memory to open what in the memory
	* missalign! (-4 works, -8 not working!)

- Remember to add: Register view, Memory view and Disassembly view to show your logic
